# Eco-WorldEdit

the WorldEdit Plugin By Mampf

I have updated it to 9.0 and made it standalone, The commands are the same but there is a few things to note:

/walls 

Using the walls command has been changed up for 9.0, When using this command you can now use it like this:

/walls Ashlar Limestone Wall

In 9.0 the block call is AshlarLimestoneWallBlock - We have auto included the Block part and removed the spaces for you when you use the command to make life easier in the next update i will force both to lower to make it easier again
